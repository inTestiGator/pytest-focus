Welcome to pytest-focus, a pytest plugin designed to make you focus as you write
test cases until they pass. This tool aims to help you stay on top of making all
the test cases in your test suite pass by relaying which ones fail to pass as
they are run and tested. Notifications will be sent detailing which test case
failed when it happens. Currently supports Linux, MacOS, and Windows 10
operating systems.
